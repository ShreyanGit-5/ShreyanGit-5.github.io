### **About Me**  
Hey! I’m Shreyan—a Computer Science undergrad who’s passionate about building creative tech solutions and solving real-world problems with code.  

### **What I Do**  
I work primarily with **Java** and **database systems**, where I love designing clean, efficient, and scalable solutions that just *make sense*.  

### **How I Think**  
I’m a lifelong learner—always curious, always leveling up. Those "aha!" moments? I live for them. Whether it's cracking a bug or mastering a new concept, I'm all in.  

### **Outside the Code**  
When I’m not coding, I’m either lifting at the gym, diving into a great book, or exploring ways to grow—mentally, physically, and creatively.  

### **Let’s Collaborate!**  
I’m always up for connecting, learning from others, or teaming up on meaningful projects. Got an idea? Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀

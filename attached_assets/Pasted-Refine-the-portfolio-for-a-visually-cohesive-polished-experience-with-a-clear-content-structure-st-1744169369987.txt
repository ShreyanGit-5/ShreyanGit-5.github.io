Refine the portfolio for a visually cohesive, polished experience with a clear content structure, stylish visuals, and smooth interactive behavior.

Homepage ‚û°Ô∏è Add a footer with LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email icons‚Äîeach visually styled and linking to their platforms.

About Me Section ‚û°Ô∏è Add a LeetCode icon and retain the Twitter icon (without label), both linked to your profiles.

Contact Page ‚û°Ô∏è Remove the Contact Information block and both Twitter/website icons. Apply artistic, intuitive hover effects to all link-icon pairs for smooth transitions and visual feedback.

Interactive Enhancements ‚û°Ô∏è Ensure all interactive elements have clear, attractive, and accessible hover states:

The "Get in Touch" button should display a hover color that contrasts well with its current blue.

Improve the "View Live Demo" and "Source Code" buttons with better color contrast for readability in the 'Read More' section.

Maintain consistent button animations, cursor styles, and click/tap feedback across all devices.

Typography & Visuals ‚û°Ô∏è Use 1‚Äì2 clean fonts (e.g., sans-serif for body, bold display for headings). Include crisp icons and high-quality project visuals with alt text for accessibility.

Layout & Spacing ‚û°Ô∏è Use ample white space for clarity. Avoid clutter, especially on smaller screens.

Consistency & Branding ‚û°Ô∏è Stick to a uniform theme‚Äîsame fonts, color palette, and design tone throughout. Add a favicon for the browser tab. Ensure call-to-action elements (like ‚ÄúContact Me‚Äù) stand out visually.

Performance & Accessibility

Optimize images and animations to load within under 3 seconds.

Add aria-labels or title attributes to icons and buttons.

Use semantic HTML and ensure the site is fully keyboard navigable.

All icon tap targets should be at least 44px on mobile.

Ensure high color contrast in both light and dark modes to meet WCAG standards.

Gracefully handle empty states or loading failures with fallbacks or error messages.

Optional (Bonus):

Add a scroll-to-top button with fade-in.

Animate favicon or show subtle loading cues during content transitions.

üí° Note: Please remember to use the .jsx files.

Why:
A consistent layout, combined with accessibility, clean design, and smooth interactions, gives your portfolio a modern, intuitive feel‚Äîmaking it not just functional but delightful to use across devices.

Please enhance the visual engagement of my personal portfolio website by integrating subtle and tasteful animations. The goal is to create a more dynamic and interactive user experience without causing distraction or impacting site performance negatively.

Specifically, I'd like to incorporate the following types of animations, potentially using Tailwind CSS's built-in transition and animation utilities or a dedicated library like Framer Motion for more complex interactions:

* **Section Appearance:** Implement smooth fade-in effects as different sections of the website (e.g., "About," "Projects," "Contact") come into the viewport during scrolling. Consider a slight upward slide combined with the fade-in for a more polished feel.
* **Project Card Interactions:** Introduce subtle hover effects on the project cards within the "Projects" section. This could include:
    * A gentle elevation or shadow increase upon hover.
    * A slight fade-in or slide-up of an overlay revealing project details (title, brief description, technologies used).
* **Button Feedback:** Apply subtle visual feedback on button hover and click states. This could involve:
    * A slight change in background color or opacity on hover.
    * A momentary scale-down or subtle ripple effect on click.
* **Navigation Highlights:** Consider a subtle underline animation or a slight color change on the active or hovered navigation links.

When implementing these animations, please ensure:

* **Smoothness:** Animations should be fluid and visually appealing, avoiding any jerky or abrupt movements. Aim for a duration that feels natural and responsive.
* **Subtlety:** The animations should be noticeable enough to enhance the experience but not so prominent that they become overwhelming or distracting to the user. The focus should remain on the content.
* **Performance:** Optimize animations to prevent any negative impact on the website's loading speed or overall performance. Avoid overly complex or resource-intensive animations.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure that the animations function correctly and look good across all screen sizes and devices.

Please advise on the best approach for implementing these animations, considering both Tailwind CSS's capabilities and the potential benefits of using a library like Framer Motion. If using Tailwind CSS, please specify which utilities would be most appropriate. If suggesting Framer Motion, provide guidance on basic implementation for the described effects.

The overall aim is to add a touch of sophistication and interactivity to the portfolio, making it more engaging and memorable for visitors.
